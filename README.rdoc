== README

This is the USMA CS450 Sample Application for HomeWork5.  It implements the Hartl Sample App from the 2d edition up to the end of Chapter 9.  The code in this repository has modifications for Ruby on Rails 4.x, newer version of Capybara, and newer version of SASS.

== Setup your development and test environment
* After forking to your GitHub account and cloneing your fork to your development
and test workstation, you will need to configure the application for your
development environment.
 bundle install --without production

* Then reconfigure the database with Faker data:
 bundle exec rake db:reset
 bundle exec rake db:populate

== Deployment into production environment
* You will need to setup your own instance of a heroku environment.  
 heroku create --stack cedar
* Deploy to your production environment on the heroku servers using:
 git push heroku master
* Reconfigure the PostgreSQL database with Faker data:
 heroku run:detached rake db:reset
 heroku run:detached rake db:populate
 
* Then you can view your application with
 heroku open
